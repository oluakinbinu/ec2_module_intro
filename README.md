## Introduction

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving cloud infrastructure and DevOps landscape, the demand for scalable and efficient solutions is critical. Terraform, as a part of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) movement, stands out as a robust and flexible tool for managing and deploying cloud resources. It empowers users to define their infrastructure through code, thereby introducing a new level of speed and automation in the setup process.

A key highlight of Terraform is its modular approach, embodied in Terraform modules. These modules act as reusable components, enabling you to package and replicate infrastructure elements efficiently. This not only improves the manageability of your code but also minimizes repetition. Understanding and using these modules is essential to elevate your Terraform projects.

This detailed guide is dedicated to diving into Terraform modules, shedding light on how they enhance and streamline your infrastructure coding efforts. Aimed at both newcomers and experienced Terraform practitioners, this article provides insights and practices for effectively utilizing modules. This will accelerate your infrastructure deployment and ensure its consistency.

Embark with us as we explore the transformative power of Terraform modules, unlocking new possibilities in managing your infrastructure.

## EC2 Module Structure

A typical module comprises a minimum of three distinct files:

- `main.tf`: This file is responsible for defining the resources that need to be created.
- `variables.tf`: This file specifies the variables that require values to be assigned to them by the module.
- `outputs.tf`: This file outlines the data that the module will supply, which can be utilized by other Terraform configurations.

As we move forward, we will explore the significance of each of these components.

### Setting Up the File Structure

Use the following commands in the terminal to establish your file structure:

```shell
mkdir -p modules/ec2
cd modules/ec2
touch var.tf main.tf outputs.tf
